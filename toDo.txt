May need to make
-edit-Art (or you could just have built-in edit functions on the page if it's the user's art they're viewing)
-imageView Page, or modal
-lostPassword/passwordRest Pages
-instead of edit-comment, user's can just edit their own comment when they come across a comment they've posted


Index
-either the tree most recent, or the three most 'liked' if I decide to implement that are show on the front
-add paragragh talking more about the site on the front page.

Gallery
-need to implement 'endless scrolling' feature to keep loading more art at the bottom of the page

Profile/Gallery page
-Like a Social-media-site, have all the user info on a side-bar, and then show the images in the main body
of the site
-If the user is looking at their page, they can edit any of their info or click and edit a peice of art


Image View Page (for when a user is looking at a specific image)
-this should be a modal that pops up, vs having to open a new page
-Shows a larger veiw of the image, as well as comments by users (but if this is done via modal
you'll have to add in buttons that let you view newer/older comments instead of doing an on-scroll thing
-If the owner of an image is looking at this, they can delete a comment on their art
-if it's NOT the owner, they can flag it.
-Images with a flagged comment will have some kind of red text/background (maybe) and will be hidden from
everyone except the image owner until it's deleted/approved.
-If the person viewing a given comment was the one who posted that comment, then they will be able to edit it


Notifications
-Let's a user see all flagged comments on their artwork, and either unflag or delete them.
(user avatar) - artwork name - comment - Approve - Delete
(username)
-Hook up the PHP so it deletes the comment - remember that you're trying to do everything through AJAX, so
you'll need a php page/script that's being referenced outside this page to handle it so it can be updated
without refreshing the page.


Upload Art
-VERY similar to the Birdey Art version. Just a pasge to let a user upload a new peice of art.
-MIGHT make this into a modal. We'll see.


Login Page
-very similar to BirdeyArt version
-just a pgae for a user to log in


Logout
-Doesn't need it's own page, just functionality
-Again, VERY similar to BirdeyArt version


Lost Password
-In case a user forgets their password and needs to reset it
-Can PROBABLY mostly reuse the pages from BirdeyArt, but may want to tweak the logic a bit. Users only need
to anwser 3 questions now.


LIKES System
-Maybe add a 'like' system so users can like atrwork posted by others. The most liked images are featured on
the front.


GENERAL
-Edit PHP SQL queries so that it works with the new fields and old fields i'm not using anymore
aren't being referenced.
